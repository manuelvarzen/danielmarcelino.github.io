Suddenly, I had to learn network analysis. Two weeks ago I started with a book by Christakis and Fowler, then a book by Kolaczyk and Csárdi, now here I am in a "how to" analyze network data using R moment. This is much like learning-by-doing knowledge, so may be useful for newcomers, although at this point I’m more concerned on visualization than measuring networks properly.

This is the part that I loved most: With just two packages, I was able to make not-so-ugly charts, saying publishable. Here, I post on how to go from unrefined to nicer charts in very few steps.
