Suddenly I had to learn some basic ideas on network analysis, so two weeks ago I started with a book by Christakis and Fowler, then a book by Kolaczyk and Cs√°rdi, now here I am in a "how to" analyze network data using R. This is much like learning-by-doing knowledge, so may be useful for newcomers, although at this point I'm more concerned on visualization than in measuring networks properly.

This is the part that I loved most: With just two packages, I was able to make not-so-ugly charts, saying publishable. Here, I post on how to go from unrefined to nicer charts in very few steps.
