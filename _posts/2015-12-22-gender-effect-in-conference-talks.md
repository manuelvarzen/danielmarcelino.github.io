I was looking around for an interesting paper to read over the weekend, when I found this: ["Studying Gender in Conference Talks -- data from the 223rd meeting of the American Astronomical Society"](http://arxiv.org/abs/1403.3091). The title and figures caught my attention more than the subject of the conference, I've to confess.
 
The plot below, taken from the paper, displays the most significant finding from the analysis: *a strong dependence on session chair gender*. As the plot suggests, there is a large difference in number of questions asked by males vis-Ã -vis number asked by females, given a male or female chair. Now, I'm wondering if this also holds for other science fields where the gap between male and female researchers is not abnormal.
