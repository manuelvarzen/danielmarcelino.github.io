I was asked about my understanding of reproducible research, and how such concept applies to social research. 
Here is how I see: Reproducible research is key to any scientific method, including applied social sciences. My minimalist understanding of reproducible research is The capacity of repeating an experiment in any place and any person.

**Same data** **+** **Same script** **=** **Same results**
 
Finally, in my view, a study can be truly reproducible when it satisfies at least the following three criteria.
- All methods are fully reported.
- All data and files used for the analysis are (publicly) available.
- The process of analyzing raw data is well reported and preserved.
