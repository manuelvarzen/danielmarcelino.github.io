![Science approach]({{ site.url }}/img/2016/science.jpg) 

I was asked about my understanding of reproducible research, and how that applies to social research. 
Here is how I see: Reproducible research is key to any scientific method, including applied social sciences. My minimalist understanding of reproducible research is quite simple: The capacity of repeating an experiment in any place with any person.

A study can be truly reproducible when it satisfies at least the following three criteria.
- All methods are fully reported.
- All data and files used for the analysis are (publicly) available.
- The process of analyzing raw data is well reported and preserved.

Therefore:
**Same data** **+** **Same script** **=** **Same results**
