Within 2 weeks, electors in Uruguay will vote for the runoff election between FA and PN. According to the polling data being published, it’s very likely Uruguayans will give FA a third mandate. I run the following forecast model which suggest that the difference between the two parties are huge; even greater than the number of undecided voters.
