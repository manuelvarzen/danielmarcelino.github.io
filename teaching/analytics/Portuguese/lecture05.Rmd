###Agenda

- Summaries with the aggregate() function
- Standard graphics

###Getting started: birthwt data set
- We're going to start by operating on the `birthwt` dataset from the MASS library

- Let's get it loaded and see what we're working with

```{r}
library(MASS)
str(birthwt)
```

###Renaming the variables
- The dataset doesn't come with very descriptive variable names

- Let's get better column names (use `help(birthwt)` to understand the variables and come up with better names)

```{r}
colnames(birthwt) 

# The default names are not very descriptive

colnames(birthwt) <- c("birthwt.below.2500", "mother.age", "mother.weight", 
    "race", "mother.smokes", "previous.prem.labor", "hypertension", "uterine.irr", 
    "physician.visits", "birthwt.grams")

# Better names!
```

###Renaming the factors
- All the factors are currently represented as integers

- Let's use the `transform()` and `mapvalues()` functions to convert variables to factors and give the factors more meaningful levels 
```{r}
library(plyr)
birthwt <- transform(birthwt, 
            race = as.factor(mapvalues(race, c(1, 2, 3), 
                              c("white","black", "other"))),
            mother.smokes = as.factor(mapvalues(mother.smokes, 
                              c(0,1), c("no", "yes"))),
            hypertension = as.factor(mapvalues(hypertension, 
                              c(0,1), c("no", "yes"))),
            uterine.irr = as.factor(mapvalues(uterine.irr, 
                              c(0,1), c("no", "yes"))),
            birthwt.below.2500 = as.factor(mapvalues(birthwt.below.2500,
                              c(0,1), c("no", "yes")))
            )
```

###Summary of the data
- Now that things are coded correctly, we can look at an overall summary

```{r}
summary(birthwt)
```

###A simple table
- Let's use the `tapply()` function to see what the average birthweight looks like when broken down by race and smoking status

```{r}
with(birthwt, tapply(birthwt.grams, INDEX = list(race, mother.smokes), FUN = mean)) 
```

###What if we wanted nicer looking output?
- Let's use the header `{r, results='asis'}`, along with the `kable()` function from the `knitr` library


```{r, results='asis'}
library(knitr)
kable(with(birthwt, tapply(birthwt.grams, INDEX = list(race, mother.smokes), FUN = mean)), format = "markdown")
```


- `kable()` outputs the table in a way that Markdown can read and nicely display

- Note: changing the CSS changes the table appearance

###aggregate() function
- Let's first recall what `tapply()` does

- Command: `tapply(X, INDEX, FUN)` 
    - Applies `FUN` to `X` grouped by factors in `INDEX`
  
- **`aggregate()`** performs a similar operation, but presents the results in a form that is at times more convenient

- There are many ways to call the `aggregate()` function

- Analog of `tapply` call: `aggregate(X, by, FUN)` 
    - Here, `by` is exactly like `INDEX`
    
###Example: tapply vs aggregate
```{r}
library(MASS)
with(birthwt, tapply(birthwt.grams, INDEX = list(race, mother.smokes), FUN = mean)) # tapply
with(birthwt, aggregate(birthwt.grams, by = list(race, mother.smokes), FUN = mean)) # aggregate
```

###Example: different syntax
- Here's a convenient alternative way to call `aggregate`

- It uses the R `formula` syntax, which we'll learn more about when we discuss regression

```{r}
aggregate(birthwt.grams ~ race + mother.smokes, FUN=mean, data=birthwt)
```

- We'll see later that `aggregate` output can be more convenient for plotting

###A closer look at low birth weight 

```{r}
weight.smoke.tbl <- with(birthwt, table(birthwt.below.2500, mother.smokes))
weight.smoke.tbl
```


- The odds of low bwt among non-smoking mothers is 

```{r} 
or.smoke.bwt <- (weight.smoke.tbl[2,2] / weight.smoke.tbl[1,2]) / (weight.smoke.tbl[2,1] / weight.smoke.tbl[1,1])
or.smoke.bwt
```

- So the odds of low birth weight are `r round(or.smoke.bwt, 1)` times higher when the mother smokes

###continuted...

- Is the mother's age correlated with birth weight?

```{r}
with(birthwt, cor(birthwt.grams, mother.age))  # Calculate correlation
```

- Does this change when we account for smoking status?

```{r}
with(birthwt, cor(birthwt.grams[mother.smokes == "yes"], mother.age[mother.smokes == "yes"]))
```

```{r}
with(birthwt, cor(birthwt.grams[mother.smokes == "no"], mother.age[mother.smokes == "no"]))
```

###Faster way: by() function
- Think of the `by(data, INDICES, FUN)` function as a `tapply()` function that operates on data frames instead of just vectors

- When using `tapply(X, INDEX, FUN)`, `X` is generally a numeric vector

- To calculate correlations, we need to allow `X` to be a data frame or matrix

```{r}
by(data = birthwt[c("birthwt.grams", "mother.age")], 
   INDICES = birthwt["mother.smokes"], 
   FUN = function(x) {cor(x[,1], x[,2])})
```



###Standard graphics in R

#### Single-variable plots

Let's continue with the `birthwt` data from the `MASS` library.

Here are some basic single-variable plots.

```{r, fig.height = 7, fig.align='center'}
par(mfrow = c(2,2)) # Display plots in a single 2 x 2 figure 
plot(birthwt$mother.age)
plot(birthwt$mother.weight)
plot(birthwt$mother.smokes)
plot(birthwt$birthwt.grams)
```

Note that the result of calling `plot(x, ...)` varies depending on what `x` is.  
    - When `x` is *numeric*, you get a plot showing the value of `x` at every index.  
    - When `x` is a *factor*, you get a bar plot of counts for every level


Let's add more information to the smoking bar plot, and also change the color by setting the `col` option.

```{r, fig.height=5, fig.width=5, fig.align='center'}
plot(birthwt$mother.smokes, main = "Mothers Who Smoked In Pregnancy", 
     xlab = "Smoking during pregnancy", 
     ylab = "Count of Mothers",
     col = 'lightblue')
```

#### Plots with several variables

If we call `plot(x,y,...)` with `x` a factor and `y` numeric, R will produce boxplots of `y` at every level of `x`.

```{r, fig.height=5, fig.width=5, fig.align='center'}
with(birthwt, plot(mother.smokes, birthwt.grams, 
                   main = "Birth Weight by Smoking Status", 
                   xlab = "Smoking during pregnancy", 
                   ylab = "Birth weight (grams)"))
```

Variables like `physician.visits` and `previous prem.labor` are low counts and not factors, but it may still be interesting to look at boxplots of birth weight at each count.  Here are the `physician.visits` boxplots.  

```{r, fig.align='center'}
with(birthwt, plot(as.factor(physician.visits), birthwt.grams,
                   main = "Birth Weight by # of Physician Visits", 
                   xlab = "# of Physician Visits", 
                   ylab = "Birth weight (grams)",
                   col = 'lightblue'))
```

When both `x` and `y` are numeric, you get a scatterplot.

```{r, fig.height=6, fig.width=6, fig.align='center'}
with(birthwt, plot(mother.age, birthwt.grams, 
                   main = "Birth Weight by Mother's Age", 
                   xlab = "Mother's Age (Years)", 
                   ylab = "Birth Weight (Grams)"))
```

That's a little boring and doesn't look very nice.  Let's see what graphics options are available to us.

```{r, fig.height=6, fig.width=6, fig.align='center'}
with(birthwt, plot(mother.age, birthwt.grams, 
                   main = "Birth Weight by Mother's Age", 
                   xlab = "Mother's Age (Years)", 
                   ylab = "Birth Weight (Grams)",
                   pch = 19, # plot solid point
                   cex = 0.7, # shrink the points by a factor of 0.7
                   col = 'steelblue', # change color to steel blue
     ))
```

Now that we have seen some of the basic plotting options, let's look at how we can construct a scatterplot overlaying points from two groups.

We'll also add a legend to explain what the different colors mean.

```{r, fig.height=6, fig.width=6, fig.align='center'}
with(birthwt, plot (mother.age, birthwt.grams, 
                    main="Birth Weight by Mother's Age", 
                    xlab="Mother's Age (Years)", 
                    ylab="Birth Weight (Grams)",
                    col=mother.smokes,
                    pch = 19,
                    cex = 0.7))

legend("bottomright", c("Non-smoker","Smoker"), col=c(1,2), pch=19)
```

#### A note on color choice

What does `col=mother.smokes` do?  Why does it color the points red and black?

First, observe that when we look at the numeric indicator of `mother.smokes`, we see that `no` is coded as 1, and `yes` is coded as 2.

```{r}
birthwt$mother.smokes
as.numeric(birthwt$mother.smokes)
```

Here's what the 8 default colors are:

```{r}
plot(rep(1, 8), pch=15, cex=5, col=1:8)
```

`col=1` is black, and `col=2` is red, which is why `col=mother.smokes` produced black and red points.

The default color palette isn't color-blind friendly, so I prefer to use the following.

```{r}
cbPalette <- c("#000000", "#E69F00", "#56B4E9", "#009E73", "#F0E442", "#0072B2", "#D55E00", "#CC79A7")

plot(rep(1, length(cbPalette)), pch=15, cex=5, col=cbPalette)
```

#### Back to scatterplots

A lot of the time your reports get printed in black and white.  To make sure that your plots still convey the same information, you can use different plotting characters in addition to different colors.  

We'll take this one step at a time by creating a vector of plotting character indicators and another vector of colors.  Both will be based on the value of `mother.smokes`

```{r, fig.height=6, fig.width=6, fig.align='center'}
points.base <- c(16, 17) # 16: circle, 17: triangle
cols.base <- cbPalette[2:3] # blue and orange points
point.symbols <- points.base[birthwt$mother.smokes] 
point.cols <- cols.base[birthwt$mother.smokes]
with(birthwt, plot(mother.age, birthwt.grams, 
                   main="Birth Weight by Mother's Age", 
                   xlab="Mother's Age (Years)", 
                   ylab="Birth Weight (Grams)",
                   col=point.cols,
                   pch=point.symbols))
legend("bottomright", c("Nonsmoker","Smoker"), col=cols.base, pch=points.base)

# Let's add a horizontal line at the 2500g cutoff
# Below 2500g, newborns are considered to be underweight
# lty = 3 indicates a dashed line (line type)
# lwd = 3 indicates a line width of 3 (default is 1)
abline(h = 2500, lty = 3, lwd = 3)
```

#### Next time: ggplot2

```{r, fig.height=5, fig.width=6, fig.align='center'}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(birthwt, aes(x=mother.age, y=birthwt.grams, shape=mother.smokes, color=mother.smokes)) + 
  geom_point() + # Adds points (scatterplot)
  geom_smooth(method = "lm") + # Adds regression lines
  ylab("Birth Weight (grams)") + # Changes y-axis label
  xlab("Mother's Age (years)") + # Changes x-axis label
  ggtitle("Birth Weight by Mother's Age") # Changes plot title
```

`ggplot2` graphics are more visually appealing, and make a lot of common statistical plotting tasks much easier.  In this example, calling `geom_smooth(method = "lm")` adds the linear regression lines for the non-smoker and smother groups, and also overlays translucent confidence bands around the regression lines.
