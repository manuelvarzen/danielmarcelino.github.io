## This month 
 
In comparison with last month, the government approval rating oscillated 2% points upward, while those disapproving downward at the same rate. For 10% of the respondents, the government is doing a “great” or “good” job, but for 69% of them, it is rather doing “bad” or “terrible". For others 21% of the respondents, the government performance is "regular".

Key points driving negative views on Dilma's administration:
- A stubborn chilling economy.
- A deteriorating political situation.
- A negative-stained image of the major parties in the governing coalition caused by long-standing corruption scandals.
