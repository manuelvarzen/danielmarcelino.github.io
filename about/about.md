## About this Website

For years, I have been studying and programming in many social sciences topics. As I do love to work with open source tools and learn from others, I created this personal space where I try to declutter some of my ideas and put my projects in order. This is easier said than done however.

I write here mainly about how R programming can be applied in social science research. Mostly in English (or sort of), sometimes in Portuguese as demand grows. 

A posting only happens after many iterations and refinements, during days and nights in front of a computer often fueled by dozens of cups of coffee and tea.
