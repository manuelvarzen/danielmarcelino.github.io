@misc{Haynes1997,
abstract = {Haynes, Gurian, and Nichols examine the influence of money in presidential nominating campaigns. Previous research has indicated that money is more important in nominating campaigns in which party identification and ideological differentiation are less useful factors. The consensus of previous research is that money is a necessary, though not sufficient condition for presidential nominating contests. The authors create a model for the 1980 through 1988 nominating contests in which their dependent variable is the percentage of the vote that each candidate receives in the primary or caucus relative to the other candidates. The independent variable of interest is the campaign spending of each candidate as a percentage of total campaign expenditures by all the candidates. The authors hold viability, homestate, incumbency, momentum, and whether the competition is between two or more candidates constant. Haynes, Gurian, and Nichols find that candidate spending is a significant factor in vote share, even in situations when ideological appeal of the candidates is taken into account. Their model shows that a 3.3% increase in spending relative to the other candidate was equivalent to a 1% increase in vote share.},

abstract = {This paper analyses how proportionality of the electoral system,\npolitical competition and corruption affect the total amount of Italian\nregional public consumption expenditure and alter the public budget\nstructure. The Italian case is particular: from 1993 the country\nunderwent a change in the electoral system (from proportional to\nmajoritarian) and, at the same time, a campaign was waged against the\ncorruption of public bureaucrats. The aim of this work is to study the\npolitical determinants of public consumption spending, and more\nspecifically the role played by political institutions (meaning\nelectoral rules), the intensity of political competition in the ``votes'\nmarket{''} and the corruption of public bureaucracy. We used panel data\nfor 20 Italian regions from 1980 to 2003 in order to estimate a quantity\neffect and an allocation effect of the degree of proportionality of the\nelectoral system, political competition and corruption of public\nbureaucracy on public consumption spending. The quantity effect of the\nproportionality of the electoral system and of the degree of political\ncompetition is positive; the same holds for corruption, meaning that\ncorruption increases the total level of public spending. Analysis of the\nallocation effect shows that corruption, rather than the electoral\nsystem and political competition, alters the public budget structure\ntowards social services and securities and general service sectors\ninstead of education and health, leading to important policy\nimplications.},

@misc{Bonneau2011,
abstract = {For years, scholars of elections have argued about whether campaign finance limitations adversely affect electoral competition. In this article, we examine how the institutional campaign finance restrictions differentially affect the performance of incumbents and challengers. Using elections for the state high court bench between 1990 and 2004, we demonstrate that candidate spending in judicial elections has diminishing marginal returns, but that the returns of challenger spending diminish more slowly than incumbent spending. Since this is the case, campaign finance restrictions that limit candidate spending disproportionate harm challengers, increasing the incumbency advantage and decreasing electoral competition. More specifically, we show that states with more stringent contribution limits have lower levels of candidate spending, and these restrictions thus put challengers at a competitive disadvantage.},

We analyze elections to Assemblies from 1980 to 2001 and determine whether candidates' vote shares are altered by changes in state campaign contribution restrictions. We find that limits on giving narrow the margin of victory of the winning candidate. Limits lead to closer elections for future incumbents, but have less effect on the margin of victory of incumbents who passed the campaign finance legislation. We also find some evidence that contribution limits increase the number of candidates in the race.},

abstract = {Theory: The congressional and state legislative elections literature suggest that candidates' performance in elections is largely a function of incumbency, campaign spending, and party support. Little is known, however, about how these variables affect candidates' vote share in city council elections. Hypotheses: I expect incumbency, campaign spending, and party organization support to be the most important predictors of candidates' vote share. In addition, I expect endorsements from local newspapers and race or ethnicity of the candidates to influence election outcomes. Methods: Multiple regression models are tested on 631 candidates who ran for the Chicago city council between 1979 and 1995. Data are from a variety of local newspapers, official campaign finance disclosure reports, and official election returns. Results: Incumbency, Democratic party support, number of opponents, campaign spending, and newspaper endorsements are all significant predictors of candidates' vote share. Democratic Party organization support is still an important component of ward-level politics in Chicago, despite a weakening of the machine at the county level. Findings also indicate that campaign spending is an increasingly important component of these contests.},

To infer effects of vote-buying on electoral behaviour, we designed and conducted a randomized field experiment during an election in Sao Tome and Principe. We follow a voter education campaign against vote-buying, using panel-survey measurements as well as disaggregated electoral results. Results show that the campaign reduced the influence of money offered on voting, decreased voter turnout, and favoured the incumbent. This evidence suggests that vote-buying increases participation and counteracts the incumbency advantage. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.},

The traditional explanation for when and why equilibrium arises is that it results from analysis and introspection by the players in a situation where the rules of the game, the rationality of the players, and the players' payoff functions are all common knowledge. Both conceptually and empirically, this theory has many problems. In The Theory of Learning in Games Drew Fudenberg and David Levine develop an alternative explanation that equilibrium arises as the long-run outcome of a process in which less than fully rational players grope for optimality over time. The models they explore provide a foundation for equilibrium theory and suggest useful ways for economists to evaluate and modify traditional equilibrium concepts.},

abstract = {Reporting effect sizes in scientific articles is increasingly widespread and encouraged by journals; however, choosing an effect size for analyses such as mixed-effects regression modeling and hierarchical linear modeling can be difficult. One relatively uncommon, but very informative, standardized measure of effect size is Cohen's f(2), which allows an evaluation of local effect size, i.e., one variable's effect size within the context of a multivariate regression model. Unfortunately, this measure is often not readily accessible from commonly used software for repeated-measures or hierarchical data analysis. In this guide, we illustrate how to extract Cohen's f(2) for two variables within a mixed-effects regression model using PROC MIXED in SAS({\textregistered}) software. Two examples of calculating Cohen's f(2) for different research questions are shown, using data from a longitudinal cohort study of smoking development in adolescents. This tutorial is designed to facilitate the calculation and reporting of effect sizes for single variables within mixed-effects multiple regression models, and is relevant for analyses of repeated-measures or hierarchical/multilevel data that are common in experimental psychology, observational research, and clinical or intervention studies.},

abstract = {Although perceived by candidates and parties as important in affecting political outcomes, the link between spending and success in multi-candidate, multiparty election campaigns remains unproven. Not only are there relatively few studies of campaign spending effects in multi-party systems, there are none examining the effect under the Single Transferable Vote (STV) electoral system. Our study examines spending effects in the Irish local elections of 1999 using STV with district magnitudes between 3 and 7 seats, contested by a median of 10 candidates in each district. Using detailed data on 1,838 candidates from 180 local constituencies and 30 councils, we provide precise estimates of the relationship between campaign spending at the candidate level in each district and electoral success, including the probability of winning. In a context where spending is miniscule relative to other contexts, and takes place under a completely different electoral system, our results echo previous studies from other contexts showing a strong effect of challenger spending and only weak effects of incumbent spending. Once allowance is made for the endogeneity of incumbent spending, however, we find a much less substantial difference between the effectiveness of spending by challengers and by incumbents, except on the marginal effect of spending on the probability of winning, where challenger spending is shown to be much more important.},

I argue that incumbents and challengers gain equally from campaign spending. This contrasts with the prominent argument about U.S. House elections that incumbents gain little from spending while challengers gain a great deal. In the U.S., incum- bents gain little because being in office generates significant name recognition and additional spend- ing suffers quickly from diminishing returns. In contrast, challengers gain a lot because they start the campaign from scratch. In Brazil, because incumbency provides fewer benefits than in the U.S., both incumbents and challengers must spend money to increase their name recognition and both benefit from spending. My findings imply that campaign spending limits in Brazil would encour- age rather than restrict competition, and they point to the importance of assessing the relative advantages of incumbency when assessing the impact of campaign spending.},

The party perceived to be less valent has a greater incentive to “sell out” to a favored minority and completely expropriate a fraction of the electorate. By reducing the difference in perceived valence, campaign-finance regulations may reduce the extent of the expropriation and achieve a more equitable political outcome. We analyze various instruments of campaign-finance regulation from this perspective.},

abstract = {Japanese elections are notorious for the money that flows between contributors, politicians, and voters. To date, however, nobody has estimated statistically the impact of this money on electoral outcomes. Students of American politics have discovered that this question is difficult to answer because, although performance may depend on spending, spending may also depend on expected performance. In this article, the authors specify a two-stage least squares model that explains the vote shares of Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) candidates as a function of their own spending, spending by other candidates, and a battery of control variables. The multiple-candidate nature of Japanese elections means that district-level demographic variables are largely unrelated to any particular LDP candidate's vote share, so that these variables can be used to create instruments for campaign spending. The authors find that the marginal dollar of campaign spending buys the spender a great deal more in Japan than is true in the United States.},

Analysis of the 1978 House election shows that three forms of model misspecification cause Jacobson to underestimate the effect of incumbent expenditures: failure to control for the quality of the challenger, inattentiveness to interaction effects, and inadequate treatment of reciprocal causation. When these biases are corrected, the marginal effect of incumbent spending is found to be substantial and, under certain circumstances, on par with the effect of challenger spending. In addition, challenger quality is shown to be an important determinant of the vote, particularly when the challenger spends heavily on his or her campaign. These findings imply that revisions to Jacobson's policy recommendations are necessary if House races are to be made more competitive.},

This article also offers a theory of campaign spending effectiveness that emphasizes a candidate’s relative potential to attract new electoral support as determined by both precampaign familiarity and personal, partisan, and ideological attributes. Challengers and incumbents obtain similar returns to spending under PR because its permissiveness encourages challengers who are limited in their abilities to build electoral support, even when they spend heavily. The theory and findings have important implications for understanding the effects of campaign finance and campaign finance regulations.},

The work improves on prior research by considering a longer, more comprehensive time frame (1978-1997) and by examining the effects of several different components of reform (contribution limits, public financing, and spending limits) within a single analytic framework. We find that spending limits reduce candidate spending and have an indirect and negative effect on electoral competition. The negative effects of spending limits, however, are heavily contingent on the level at which the limit is set. Contribution limits are associated with increased disparities in candidate spending and increased incumbent spending but have no direct effects on electoral competition. Overall, whether campaign finance reform enhances or inhibits electoral competition depends very much on the combination of spending limits, contribution limits, and public financing enacted in a given state.},

We offer a replicable framework for the measurement of campaign diversification as well as for the evaluation of its effects on electoral performance. We examine how factors such as campaign expenditure and candidates' incumbency status condition the effects of campaign diversification. It is shown that diversification is only related to electoral success when campaigns are well-financed. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {The skyrocketing cost of U.S. Senate campaigns has led to proposals to limit candidates' spending. Republican opposition to spending limits has been based on the belief that such limits would adversely affect the minority party, since its challengers would need to spend more than the allowable limit in order to overcome the electoral advantage enjoyed by Democratic incumbents. However, very few GOP challengers in 1986 or 1988 reached the spending ceilings which have been proposed in recent reform legislation. In general, Republican challengers have had difficulty raising adequate campaign war chests, even in years such as 1984 when GOP prospects appeared promising. In the long run, spending limits might work to the advantage of the Republican party by causing Senate candidates to rely more heavily on independent expenditures and indirect financial support from party committees.},

Although most research on campaign spending focuses on challengers rather than incumbents, incumbent spending clearly wins elections, making campaign spending a critical factor in the competitiveness of congressional elections. Spending limits applied to both challengers and incumbents favor those already elected. Therefore limits on campaign spending will only be detrimental to challengers. The author used a reduced form relationship to summarize the mechanism by which spending influences voting, which results in a useful approximation of a complicated process, and that further work is needed in areas such as sources of candidate funds.},

This model, which provides a tool for comparative politics research analogous to that which regression propose a comprehensive statistical model for analyzing multiparty, district-level elections. This analysis provides in the American two-party context, can be used to explain or predict how geographic distributions of electoral results depend upon economic conditions, neighborhood ethnic compositions, campaign spending and other features of the election campaign or aggregate areas. We also provide new graphical representations for data exploration, model evaluation, and substantive interpretation. We illustrate the use of this model by attempting to resolve a controversy over the size of and trend in the electoral advantage of incumbency in Britain. Contrary to previous analyses, all based on measures now known to be biased, we demonstrate that the advantage is small but meaningful, varies substantially across the parties, and is not growing. Finally, we show how to estimate the party from which each party's advantage is predominantly drawn.},

@misc{Levitt1997,
abstract = {While it is widely believed by academics, politicians, and the popu- lar press that incumbent members of Congress are rewarded by the electorate for bringing federal dollars to their district, the em- pirical evidence supporting that claim is extremely weak. One ex- planation for the failure to uncover the expected relationship be- tween federal spending and election outcomes is that incumbents who expect to have difficulty being reelected are likely to exert greater effort in obtaining federal outlays. Since it is generally im- possible to adequately measure this effort, the estimated impact of spending is biased downward because of an omitted variable bias. We address this estimation problem using instrumental variables. For each House district, we use spending outside the district but inside the state containing the district as an instrument for spend- ing in the district. Federal spending is affected by a large number of actors (e.g., governors, senators, mayors, and other House mem- bers in the state delegation), leading to positive correlations in federal spending across the House districts within states. However, federal spending outside of a district is unlikely to be strongly cor- related with the strength of that district's electoral challenge. In contrast to previous studies, we find strong evidence that federal spending benefits congressional incumbents: an additional $100 per capita in spending is worth as much as 2 percent of the popular vote. The only category of federal spending that does not appear to yield electoral rewards is direct transfers to individuals.},

abstract = {As political scientists begin to incorporate biological influences as explanatory factors in political behavior, the need to present a methodological road map for utilizing biometric genetic theory and twin data is apparent. The classical twin design (CTD) remains the most popular design for initial examinations of the source of variance among social and political behaviors, and a vast majority of advanced variance components models as well as some molecular analyses are extensions of the CTD. Thus, it is appropriate to begin a series of works with the CTD and its most common variants. The CTD has strong roots in biometrical genetic theory and provides estimates of the correlations between observed traits of monozygotic and dizygotic twins in terms of underlying genetic and environmental influences. The majority of these analyses utilize SEMs of observed covariances for both twin types to assess the relative importance of these ``latent'' factors.},

Most of events and situations could be projected by the eye of game theory on the aspect that there always exist conflicts and co-operation on the interactions in them. Game theory was originated form economics, one of social science, but it applies to not just social system but also the realm of nature. For example we could see the molecular world of materials with game theoretic viewpoint. Molecules in material are connected or interacted with each other by several different kinds of physical forces like metallic bond, ionic bond, van der Waals forces, etc. This book provides leading-edge research from around the world on this field.},

abstract = {Nearly all research on campaign finance overlooks important intermediaries between candidate spending and electoral outcomes. We consider the effects of campaign spending on a variety of factors important to the health of any democracy and political community: trust, efficacy, involvement, at- tention, knowledge, and affect. Our analysis of the 1994 and 1996 U.S. House elections shows that the effects of campaign spending lie more on the side of democratic boon than democratic bane. Campaign spending increases knowledge of and affect toward the candidates, improves the public's ability to place candidates on ideology and issue scales, and encourages certainty about those placements. Rather than permit House members to mask their voting records, incumbent spending helps improve the accuracy of citizen perceptions of the incumbent's ideology. Spending neither enhances nor erodes trust and efficacy in politics or attention and interest in campaigns. We conclude that campaign spending contributes to key aspects of democracy such as knowledge and affect, while not damaging public trust or involvement},

abstract = {Traditionally, research on political campaigns has focused on the positioning of parties and not on how parties communicate with the electorate. We construct a model where two parties fund both the "creative" and "media" elements of political advertising and examine how campaign budgets affect advertising strategies in the context of a political campaign. Our key finding is that tight campaign limits stimulate aggressive advertising on the part of competing parties, while generous budgets often lead to parties acting defensively. The analysis also provides an explanation for the increasingly partisan campaigns that the Republicans and Democrats have taken in recent elections. When there is significant polarization amongst noncommitted voters and campaign spending limits are higher, we find that parties "retrench" toward traditional constituencies. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

This study explores the impact of campaign spending and campaign activists on support levels for the national parties contesting the Canadian federal election of 1988, and builds on parallel work done in the U.K. Despite the unusually nationalized character of the 1988 election (dominated by the issue of the Free Trade Agreement with the U.S.), we are able to demonstrate convincingly that local campaigns do matter for most candidates. Specifically, campaign effects were strongest for candidates running for the opposition parties, especially those who ran non-winning campaigns. Our results suggest that the local party organizations of non-winning candidates are in the position of being able to realize potentially significant electoral returns through the mobilization of additional personnel or financial resources in their constituency campaigns.},

@article{Sartori1991,
abstract = {I seek to explain the disappointing performance of the field of comparative politics addressing the three basic questions: Why compare? What is comparable? and How? I also challenge the view that the methodology of comparison is pretty well known and established. Hosts of unsettled issues remain, while a growing cause of frustration and failure is the undetected proliferation of `cat-dogs' (or worse), that is, nonexistent aggregates which are bound to defy, on account of their non-comparable characteristics, any and all attempts at law-like generalizations. The bottom line is that the comparative endeavor suffers from loss of purpose.

Sartori vs Jean Blondel: In the text, Sartori opposes to Blondel on the purpose of comparing. Sartori addresses three questions in the paper: Why compare? What is comparable? and How? He concludes that comparative approach suffers from loss of purpose. Therefore, he makes the point that the preliminary point must thus be to establish the distinctiveness of comparative politics as a field characterized by a method. Sartori: comparing is controlling. To classify is to order a given universe into classes that are mutually exclusive and jointly exhaustive. Case studies cannot be considered as comparative research, but heuristic case studies do provide an ideal--perhaps the best--soil for the conceiving of generalizations. If so, however, case studies are first and foremost part and parcel of theory-building, not of theory-controlling. "On balance, case studies sacrifice generality to depth and thickness of understanding, indeed to Verstehen: one knows more and better about less (less in extension). Conversely, comparative studies sacrifice understanding-in-context -- and of context -- to inclusiveness: one knows less about more." Concept: "in order to make a concept more general, viz. of increasing its travelling capability, we must reduce its characteristics or properties. Conversely, in order to make a concept more specific (contextually adequate), we must increase its properties or characteristics.},

@book{Gintis2009,
abstract = {Game theory is central to understanding human behavior and relevant to all of the behavioral sciences--from biology and economics, to anthropology and political science. However, as The Bounds of Reason demonstrates, game theory alone cannot fully explain human behavior and should instead complement other key concepts championed by the behavioral disciplines. Herbert Gintis shows that just as game theory without broader social theory is merely technical bravado, so social theory without game theory is a handicapped enterprise. Gintis illustrates, for instance, that game theory lacks explanations for when and how rational agents share beliefs. Rather than construct a social epistemology or reasoning process that reflects the real world, game theorists make unwarranted assumptions which imply that rational agents enjoy a commonality of beliefs. But, Gintis explains, humans possess unique forms of knowledge and understanding that move us beyond being merely rational creatures to being social creatures. For a better understanding of human behavior, Gintis champions a unified approach and in doing so shows that the dividing lines between the behavioral disciplines make no scientific sense. He asks, for example, why four separate fields--economics, sociology, anthropology, and social psychology--study social behavior and organization, yet their basic assumptions are wildly at variance. The author argues that we currently have the analytical tools to render the behavioral disciplines mutually coherent. Combining the strengths of the classical, evolutionary, and behavioral fields, The Bounds of Reason reinvigorates the useful tools of game theory and offers innovative thinking for the behavioral sciences.},

@book{Tsutsui2001,
abstract = {Japanese industry is the envy of the world for its efficient and humane management practices. Yet, as William Tsutsui argues, the origins and implications of "Japanese-style management" are poorly understood. Contrary to widespread belief, Japan's acclaimed strategies are not particularly novel or even especially Japanese. Tsutsui traces the roots of these practices to Scientific Management, or Taylorism, an American concept that arrived in Japan at the turn of the century. During subsequent decades, this imported model was embraced--and ultimately transformed--in Japan's industrial workshops. Imitation gave rise to innovation as Japanese managers sought a "revised" Taylorism that combined mechanistic efficiency with respect for the humanity of labor. Tsutsui's groundbreaking study charts Taylorism's Japanese incarnation, from the "efficiency movement" of the 1920s, through Depression-era "rationalization" and wartime mobilization, up to postwar "productivity" drives and quality-control campaigns. Taylorism became more than a management tool; its spread beyond the factory was a potent intellectual template in debates over economic growth, social policy, and political authority in modern Japan. Tsutsui's historical and comparative perspectives reveal the centrality of Japanese Taylorism to ongoing discussions of Japan's government-industry relations and the evolution of Fordist mass production. He compels us to rethink what implications Japanese-style management has for Western industries, as well as the future of Japan itself.},

Reanalysis of the 1972 and 1974 House and Senate campaign spending data using both OLS and 2SLS regression models shows that spending by challengers has a much greater impact on the outcome than does spending by incumbents. A similar analysis of the effects of spending on voters' recall of candidates int eh 1972 and 1974 SRC surveys supports the explanation that campaign expenditures buy nonimcumbents the necessary voter recognition already enjoyed by incumbents prior to the campaign. The 1974 survey questions on Senate candidates indicate that, although the inability to remember the candidates' names does not preclude having opinions about them, voters recalling candidates are much more likely to offer evaluative comments, and these more frequently refere to candidates personally. Aware voters offer more negative as well as positive evaluations (though positive outnumber negative); familiarity is not automaticallly advantageous. And voters' evaluations of candidates strongly influence how they vote. The implications of these findings for congressional campaign finance policy are readily apparent.},

abstract = {Researchers sometimes argue that statisticians have little to contribute when few realizations of the process being estimated are observed. We show that this argument is incorrect even in the extreme situation of estimating the probabilities of events so rare that they have never occurred. We show how statistical forecasting models allow us to use empirical data to improve inferences about the probabilities of these events. Our application is estimating the probability that your vote will be decisive in a U.S. presidential election, a problem that has been studied by political scientists for more than two decades. The exact value of this probability is of only minor interest, but the number has important implications for understanding the optimal allocation of campaign resources, whether states and voter groups receive their fair share of attention from prospective presidents, and how formal "rational choice" models of voter behavior might be able to explain why people vote at all. We show how the probability of a decisive vote can be estimated empirically from state-level forecasts of the presidential election and illustrate with the example of 1992. Based on generalizations of standard political science forecasting models, we estimate the (prospective) probability of a single vote being decisive as about 1 in 10 million for close national elections such as 1992, varying by about a factor of 10 among states. Our results support the argument that subjective probabilities of many types are best obtained through empirically based statistical prediction models rather than solely through mathematical reasoning. We discuss the implications of our findings for the types of decision analyses used in public choice studies.},

abstract = {<p>Very little evidence exists on which forms of voter contact have the greatest impact on election outcomes. In this article we attempt to assess systematically the effect of different forms of voter contact on congressional vote choice. By estimating a system of equations for spending and vote choice with three different forms of personal and media contact we are able to investigate how different forms of contact directly affect the vote choice as well as mediate the impact of candidate spending. We find that incumbents and challengers benefit differently from the different forms of contact. Challengers tend to get a bigger direct effect from contact in general probably because as a group they are less well known than incumbents. Incumbents, on the other hand, seem able to use contact through the media to maintain their advantage. Contact through television enhances the effect of spending to a much greater extent than is true for challengers, suggesting that incumbents who reach a large percentage of the electorate are difficult to beat.},

Incumbent candidates can at best expect to win 1.01% of the popular vote for each extra franc they spend per registered voter in their district. Challengers can expect to win at least twice as much as this. Simulations show that if campaign spending ceilings were halved, incumbents would have gained an extra ten percent of the popular vote over their closest challenging rivals. The regression analysis also suggests that voters react negatively to candidates who rely heavily on their own money for their outlays and reward candidates who rely on contributions from private individuals. These results suggest that campaign spending ceilings may inhibit political competition, and that voters may resist a candidate who relies on narrow sources of funding.},

They argue that people tend to vote with their groups, and to the extent that people take longer to come to a vote choice, this is the result of cross-pressures from different groups that one belongs to, leading to a general disinterest in the election. The other key argument is that voters tend to be persuaded more by personal contacts than by campaign propaganda, giving the opinion-leaders a special place in the electoral process. They also propose the beginnings of the minimal effects account of campaigns, but call it the bottleneck of persuasion.},

In much of this research, however, the political context of the elections studied is ignored or fitted into Key's category of normal or maintaining elections, where voting patterns remain relatively constant from one election to another. There are few, if any, reports of money - votes relationships associated with other types of elections. Analysis of a deviating election followed by two reinstating elections in the state of New South Wales, Australia, from 1988 to 1995 confirms the generality of postulated relationships between campaign spending and voting patterns, even allowing for some degree of underestimation associated with a misreading of voter intentions by the major parties in times of electoral volatility. Further insights into money - votes relationships are provided from particular features of Australian elections: a focus on marginal seats associated with strategic use of a public funding component of election-campaign expenditure, compulsory voting, and the use of an alternative vote or preferential voting system.},

We direct our attention at how voters perceive competition, and at how electoral competition affects how people perceive elections. Although people generally overestimate the competitiveness of U.S. House races, we demonstrate that perceptions of competition are connected to actual levels of campaign activity. We also find that electoral competition may have contradictory democratic effects. District-level spending is associated with greater attention to news about the local campaign, but also with greater dissatisfaction with election choices.},

What is more, campaign spending is clearly associated with voting, increasing support for the spending party and decreasing support for its rivals. Contrary to the accepted wisdom, local campaign spending can result in important shifts in the vote. However, local campaigning seems to be of much more value to challengers than to incumbents.},

abstract = {In contrast to conventional studies on campaign finance, which focus on the aggregate effect of money on the vote, we propose a more general dynamic model based on temporally disaggregated data. The model is supported by the substantive understanding that at different stages of the campaign process candidates have different goals, and their expenditures should have different effects on the final election outcome. Using Achen's (1986) framework of quasi experiments, the model includes dynamic “assignment equations” and “outcome equations”, which address the problem of nonrandom assignment. A final vote equation is derived in which the coefficients of period-specific incumbent expenditures are constrained by an Almon polynomial. Empirical estimation provides evidence for a three-stage dynamic campaign process.},

abstract = {Although observers of Brazilian politics commonly hold that voters reward incumbents for “bring- ing home the bacon,” I provide reasons to question the direct link between pork and electoral success as well as statistical evidence demonstrating the lack of such a link. This generates a puzzle: if pork barreling is ineffective, why do Brazilian deputies spend so much time seeking pork? The answer is that deputies do not trade pork for votes, they trade pork for money: pork- barrel success helps incumbents raise funds from private sector interests that profit from govern- ment contracts. In turn, politicians’ access to money, not pork, directly affects their electoral prospects. This article provides a new understanding of the electoral connection in Brazil by showing that existing analyses either have overestimated pork’s impact or are underdetermined because they have not included measures of campaign finance. The findings should also encourage comparativ- ists interested in pork-barrel politics, clientelism, the personal vote, and campaign behavior more generally to focus attention on the role of money in elections},

While variables reflecting party affiliation, the incumbent's vote in the last election, and scandal associated with incumbents are important determinants of the vote, changes in both local federal spending on construction and federal civilian employment in the incumbent's district are shown to have no effect on the share of the vote going to incumbents.

abstract = {The effects of campaign spending on electoral outcomes remains relatively untested in comparative, multiparty contexts. Spending effects under the Single-Transferable Vote (STV) electoral system have received almost no attention from political scientists but that system's facilitation of candidate centered voting with the otherwise conventional partisan context common in parliamentary democracies makes it especially interesting. Our study develops a model of competition and electoral success under STV and applies it to the Irish national election of May 2002. Using spending and electoral data gathered on 464 candidates from 42 constituencies to elect Ireland's 166-member legislature, we parameterize and then statistically estimate the effects of candidate spending in both absolute and relative terms. Testing both inter- and intra-party spending effect we find a positive and statistically significant relationship between spending and electoral success. Increased spending on behalf of a candidate brings more votes for that candidate, in competition against not only all candidates but also in competition with own-party running mates. Increased spending also directly increases a candidate’s chance of winning a seat.},

abstract = {Many scholars have argued that money politics in Japan has been driven in part by the imperatives of intraparty competition under the single, nontransferable vote (SNTV) system used for lower house elections until 1994. However, to date, no one has undertaken a systematic, quantitative study of campaign expenditure in Japan. In this article, the authors exploit the intraelection reports-which are believed to be accurate accounts of spending during the brief official campaign-to investigate how Japanese candidates adapted their last-minute expenditures to SNTV. The authors show that candidates spent more when they faced more intraparty competition. The results for Liberal Democratic Party candidates suggest that intraparty competition boosted campaign-period spending by approximately 4 % to 18%. The authors also find evidence that the spending appears to be reactive, with candidates increasing their expenditures to counter higher spending by other candidates and especially spending by copartisans.},

abstract = {<p>This study re-examines the influence of business campaign contributions on congressional voting behavior. We find that previous empirical work has not fully considered the distinct funding mechanisms campaign contributors use to channel funds to representatives or the diversity of legislative policy instruments used to reward contributors. We correct these shortcomings by analyzing both individual and PAC campaign contributions from business interests and building several indexes of macro business policy votes in the 105th Congress. These improved measures are used in conjunction with an assumption of "tactical rationality" that predicts legislators utilize diverse policy instruments to balance benefits and costs associated with rewarding business campaign contributors. This theoretical claim is than tested in vote choice models that, in all, account for over fifty business policy votes. Our primary findings are that businesses apparently use campaign contributions to influence favorable regulatory and tax policy votes, but are much less influential on votes for direct government expenditures that benefit business. This difference in influence by policy instrument is especially pronounced regarding contributions from individuals with business interests. We find these results to be entirely consistent with a view of rationality in which representatives seek to trade votes for campaign contributions without the appearance of an embarrassing quid pro quo.},

abstract = {Everybody knows that "the economy" matters in presidential elections, but how can one incorporate economic information in an early forecasting equation? Our economic forecasting tool is the cumulative growth of leading indicators during a presidential term-weighting recent growth most heavily-which provides an early warning, as early as quarter 1 of the election year, about the Election Day economy. To control for other, non-economic factors, our model also includes presidential approval or trial-heat polls. In this paper we show how cumulative leading indicators measured early in the election year actually reveal as much about the final vote as cumulative income growth observed on the eve of the election. That is, voters respond at least as much to economic change that is predicted well in advance of elections as to economic surprises that are felt during the course of the campaign. Approval judgments incorporate these effects over the course of the election year. Very late economic shocks matter, to be sure, but they are not known until well after the campaign. The findings are informative about how the economy matters on Election Day, and have implications for our ability to forecast the outcome well in advance. ?? 2008 International Institute of Forecasters.},

Analysis of the measured efficiency scores of the incumbents and challengers shows that there are significant systematic effects of both district and candidate characteristics. The incumbent's residuals from the efficiency score regressions indicate those candidates who do well because of the nature of their district and those who do well because of their own abilities. Incumbents are ranked according to their observed efficiency, their unobserved efficiency and their vote share. Correlations among the rankings are significant and of the expected signs. More efficient candidates receive higher vote shares.},

abstract = {“Strong” political parties within legislatures are one possible solution to the problem of inefficient universalism, a norm under which all legislators seek large projects for their districts that are paid for out of a common pool. We demonstrate that even if parties have no role in the legislature, their role in elections can be sufficient to reduce spending. If parties in the electorate are strong, then legislators will demand less distributive spending because of a decreased incentive to secure a “personal vote” via local projects. We estimate that spending in states with strong party organizations is at least 4% smaller than in states where parties are weak. We also find evidence that strong party states receive less federal aid than states with weak organizations, and we theorize that this is because members of Congress from strong party states feel less compelled to secure aid than members from weak party states.},

@book{Laffont2009,
abstract = {Economics has much to do with incentives--not least, incentives to work hard, to produce quality products, to study, to invest, and to save. Although Adam Smith amply confirmed this more than two hundred years ago in his analysis of sharecropping contracts, only in recent decades has a theory begun to emerge to place the topic at the heart of economic thinking. In this book, Jean-Jacques Laffont and David Martimort present the most thorough yet accessible introduction to incentives theory to date. Central to this theory is a simple question as pivotal to modern-day management as it is to economics research: What makes people act in a particular way in an economic or business situation? In seeking an answer, the authors provide the methodological tools to design institutions that can ensure good incentives for economic agents. This book focuses on the principal-agent model, the "simple" situation where a principal, or company, delegates a task to a single agent through a contract--the essence of management and contract theory. How does the owner or manager of a firm align the objectives of its various members to maximize profits? Following a brief historical overview showing how the problem of incentives has come to the fore in the past two centuries, the authors devote the bulk of their work to exploring principal-agent models and various extensions thereof in light of three types of information problems: adverse selection, moral hazard, and non-verifiability. Offering an unprecedented look at a subject vital to industrial organization, labor economics, and behavioral economics, this book is set to become the definitive resource for students, researchers, and others who might find themselves pondering what contracts, and the incentives they embody, are really all about.},

abstract = {Incomplete understanding of the connection between campaign spending and election outcomes has hindered evaluation of enacted and proposed congressional campaign finance reforms. Reanalysis of the 1972 and 1974 House and Senate campaign spending data using both OLS and 2SLS regression models shows that spending by challengers has a much greater impact on the outcome than does spending by incumbents. A similar analysis of the effects of spending on voters' recall of candidates int eh 1972 and 1974 SRC surveys supports the explanation that campaign expenditures buy nonimcumbents the necessary voter recognition already enjoyed by incumbents prior to the campaign. The 1974 survey questions on Senate candidates indicate that, although the inability to remember the candidates' names does not preclude having opinions about them, voters recalling candidates are much more likely to offer evaluative comments, and these more frequently refere to candidates personally. Aware voters offer more negative as well as positive evaluations (though positive outnumber negative); familiarity is not automaticallly advantageous. And voters' evaluations of candidates strongly influence how they vote. The implications of these findings for congressional campaign finance policy are readily apparent.},

abstract = {Perhaps no other issue surrounding the health of our democracy worries American voters more than the role of money in elections, and campaign finance reform is a salient topic as a result. Academic studies of campaign finance, however, have focused their analyses at the level of the individual campaign – relevant for a variety of important questions but not calibrated for studying the impact of policy instruments that affect the entire legislature at once. I offer a new focus on the systemic effects of campaign spending. Using a natural experiment in U.S. state legislatures, I find that a ten percentage point increase in the Democratic (or Republican) share of total campaign contributions causes a five percentage point increase in the Democratic (or Republican) share of the legislature. Campaign spending has a large effect on electoral outcomes, and regulations on which groups are permitted to donate are a potent policy lever.},

Over time people forget most of the campaign information they are exposed to but are nonetheless able to later recollect their summary affective evaluation of candidates which they then use to inform their preferences and vote choice. These findings have substantive, methodological, and normative implications for the study of electoral behavior. Substantively, we show how campaign information affects voting behavior. Methodologically, we demonstrate the need to measure directly what campaign information people actually attend to over the course of a campaign and show that after controling for the individual's on-line assessment of campaign messages, National Election Study-type recall measures prove to be spurious as explanatory variables. Finally, we draw normative implications for democratic theory of on-line processing, concluding that citizens appear to be far more responsive to campaign messages than conventional recall models suggest.},

abstract = {Vote buying is a frequent practice during election time in many parts of the world. But no research has been done to quantify its effects on voters’ electoral behavior. To address this challenge, we have designed and conducted a randomized experiment during the presidential elections of July 2006 in Sao Tome and Principe. This is a newly found oil-rich West African country that has been facing an increase in ‘retail’ vote buying. Our research design included a randomized campaign against vote buying sponsored by the Electoral Commission of the country, and pre-electoral campaign/post-election panel surveys in treatment (exposed to the campaign) and control locations, including 1034 subjects across 50 different areas. We observe a significant effect of the campaign on perceptions of vote buying, which constitutes the exogenous variation we use to identify effects on voting behavior. We characterize determinants of vote buying (more frequent in swing and rural locations), and find that vote buying energizes the electorate by increasing turnout. Crucially, we capture real effects on candidates’ relative performance, by identifying the challenger to be driving more votes through vote buying (after the treatment), which is consistent with the timeline of events (late challenger candidacy). This result controls for changes in information about the candidates (e.g. policy platforms) and location-specific minutes spent by international electoral observers.},

Differences in cam operate paign spending associated with state campaign finance laws allows for a test of this hypothesis because restrictions on campaign contributions tend to reduce campaign spending. Exploiting cross-state variation in campaign finance laws, this study tests whether campaign expenditures by state House candidates are more when candidates are subject to contribution productive limits. The results show that campaign by incumbents and challengers are more expenditures when candidates run in states with contribution to in limits, productive campaign as opposed states without limits. In states with contribution incumbent limits, spending and challenger spending are equally productive, and spending by both candidates is quantitatively important in increasing their vote shares. 1.

We find that contribution limits do not influence candidate spending. If the goal of reform is to reduce candidate spending--or to affect electoral competition or voter turnout by reducing candidate spending--our results suggest that state public financing is more likely to be successful than contributions limits.},

Logit voting regressions are estimated with more than three dozen explanatory variables using survey and aggregate data for the 1979, 1980, 1984, and 1988 Canadian national elections. We find that the usual demographic variables such as age and education, and contextual variables such as campaign spending have significant effects on the probability of voting, but the models have low R2's and cannot predict who votes more accurately than random guessing. We also estimate regressions using past voting behavior as a predictor of current behavior, and find that although the explanatory power rises it remains low. This suggests that the difficulty in explaining turnout arises primarily from omitted time-varying variables. In some sense, then, it appears that whether or not a person votes is to a large degree random. The evidence provides support for the rational voter theory, and is problematic for psycho/sociological approaches.},

abstract = {This paper presents a model which captures the three main arguments for and against campaign spending limits. Campaign spending limits are purported to restrict the incumbent's ability to exploit his fundraising advantage. In contrast to conventional wisdom, a ceiling increases the incumbent's probability of victory regardless of the candidates' relative fundraising abilities as long as the challenger is not more effective in campaign spending. If the challenger is more effective in campaign spending, ceilings have a non-monotonic effect when the incumbent enjoys a mild initial voter disposition advantage; A moderate ceiling decreases the incumbent's probability of victory but further restricting the limit favors the incumbent. Irrespective of incumbency status, the marginal benefit to quality decreases with a more restrictive cap. In an open-seat contest, a more restrictive limit improves the electoral prospects of the superior quality candidate. Stricter ceilings may lead to the unintended consequence of increased expected spending. ?? 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {This paper seeks to understand the effect of campaign finance laws on electoral outcomes. Spurred by the recent Supreme Court decision, Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission (2010), which eliminated bans on corporate and union political spending, the study focuses on whether such bans generate electoral outcomes that are notably different from an electoral system that lacks such bans. We look to two key electoral dynamics that such bans might influence: the partisan balance of power and the success of incumbents. Using historical data on regulations in 49 American states between 1968 and 2009 we test alternative models for evaluating the impact of corporate spending bans put in place during this period. The results indicate that spending bans appear to have limited effects on election outcomes. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

Green and Krasno's (1988) recent attempt to solve the problem - and to demonstrate that marginal returns on spending as a great for incumbents as for challengers - again comes up short. A panel feature of the ABC News/Washington Post Congressional District Poll conducted during the 1986 elections offers a fresh perspective on the question. Analysis of changes in voting intentions during the final six weeks of the campaign shows that, as the trained OLS studies have invariably suggested, the amount spent by the challenger is far more important in accounting for voter's decisions than is the amount spent by the incumbent.},

Challengers gained support over time in direct proportion to their level of spending. Incumbents adjusted their level of spending to that of their challengers, and their levels of familiarity and favorability increased over time, but to a degree unrelated to how much they spent. Their expenditures did not appear to offset the effects produced by challengers' spending. ?? 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},
