In a recent study (news story), 129 residents of an Italian town were asked about their attitude toward a controversial expansion of a nearby U.S. military base. Researchers found that the opinions of 33 “undecideds” could be predicted a week in advance by a series of questions relevant to the issue. This result raises the possibility that decisions exist in an internal form before people can report them.

The work is reminiscent of neuroscience research by Antonio Damasio and colleagues, who found a way to measure the gap between hunch and recognition. People were asked to play a pretend gambling game in which they could choose cards from several decks. Without the participants’ knowledge, some of the decks were stacked against them. After losing repeatedly, they began to choose the more favorable decks but were unable to say why until after much further play.

So even when we claim to be undecided, we may have strong preferences that we cannot report to a questioner. This creates a major problem in interpreting the answers to opinion polls. There may not be many undecided voters out there at all.

Wait a sec: We have a situation where the margin amongst decided voters changes (in this instance, moving in favor of Obama by 9 points), but the numbers of undecideds remain the same.

To me the most likely scenario is that a number of undecideds have shifted to Obama, while an equal number of previously-decided McCain voters have now become unsure. Doesn’t this seem more intuitively right than a bunch of decided people changing their minds completely, while the undecideds in between fail to make a choice? Scold me if this has already been put forth.

Imagine a sort of upside-down bell curve, with “candidate preference” as the x-axis and “decidedness” as the y-axis. The more strongly you prefer a certain candidate, the more likely you are to consider yourself “decided”, with a sort of valley of undecideds in the middle. In such a situation, if one pushes the preference of the nation as a whole in one direction, then some of the undecideds will now be pushed over the threshold into decided territory, and on the other end, some who previously considered themselves decided fall into the valley.

If you take this as a model, it brings up all sorts of interesting stuff, because we don’t know how the actual population is distributed along the x-axis. For example, if there are a tremendous number of McCain supporters who identify themselves as “decided”, but are very close to the valley, and there are relatively small numbers of people in the undecided group, then a shift in mass public opinion in favor of Obama would create a big point shift, not because he gains a lot of newly decided voters, but because previously decided McCain voters suddenly become uncertain. You would be able to detect such a situation if the poll margin changed and the number of undecideds expanded. That hasn’t happened, which would suggest under this model that the distribution of the voting public along the “preference” axis is generally flat.
