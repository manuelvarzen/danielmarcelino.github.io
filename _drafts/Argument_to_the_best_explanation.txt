I'm sure many of you are familiar with the problem solving technique known as Occam's Razor. The principle of Occam's Razor is "the simplest explanation is usually the right one". If one uses ONLY the known facts, and not anyone's testimony, I believe Occam's Razor would indicate that both Adnan and Jay are responsible for Hae's death.
I'll explain this rationale. We know the following facts: 1. Adnan was called Hae three times the night before her disappearance. 2. Adnan called Jay first the next day. 3. Adnan and Jay were present together and Jay became in possession of Adnan's phone during school. 4. Hae and her car went missing after school. 5. Adnan and Jay were present together after school. 6. Jay was in knowledge of the whereabouts of Hae's car.
If one uses this information and applies Occam's Razor to try to deduce who was likely responsible for Hae's murder, the simplest explanation would be that Adnan and Jay are responsible. What do you guys think? Do you agree that the simplest explanation, given only the concrete facts, is that Adnan and Jay are responsible for Hae's death?

Hae turns up murdered.
Simplest explanation is the dumped boyfriend who can't let go and calls her several time the previous night, when she was with her new boyfriend round midnight, and who was trying to get a ride with her before she disappeared killed her.
How much evidence are we ignoring in the simplification? I'm not ignoring Hae's death, but neither am I accepting the time the state said it occurred.
And Jay was clearly involved in some way. Your Adnan solo theory would have to explain how Jay knew so much.

I have to agree with the other commenter here. It's not, "Simplest answer for why Adnan called Hae," it's: "Simplest answer for why Adnan called Hae several times the night before she was killed."
Leaving the murder out removes the proper context, and you need that when looking for that simple explanation. I mean otherwise you could break the entire case down into separate parts and come up with simple reasons for every separate event, but it's the whole that we're looking at here.

The UK prohibits Beyesian analysis in court because it lends an air of scientific certainty to subjective opinion, does it not?
I think that might be the case, based on this article but IDK anything about it.
I blogged myself about why historians (I would include criminal investigators as a kind of historian) ought to use Bayes.
There is a terrific book called The Criminal Brain that delves into this. There may very well soon be ways to tell likelihood of criminality through brain scans and history. But ethically, can the state make use of it?
As far as maths and statistics, I'm afraid I can be of little help. I know that, in a series of coin flips, whether the coin has just come up heads five times in a row makes no difference as to the likelihood of heads appearing again.
There is a problem with how the human brain understands small probabilities. In all the millions of criminal cases, there will be a handful that the circumstantial evidence is 100% against a suspect, and yet that suspect is innocent. This could be one of those cases, which is one of the reasons I think it is so fascinating. It's like a reverse lottery ticket.

Do you think the priors should be unequal? Why?

I'm not going to explain Bayes' Theorem myself but it's explained here and here.
The two hypotheses I compare are 'Adnan is guilty as per the essentials of Jay's story' (A) and 'Jay is guilty, Adnan innocent' (J).
For each piece of evidence cited, I will give my estimate of how likely it was to be the outcome of each hypothetical scenario, and formulate the relative probability as a ratio. (The evidence I cite will be drawn from my posts so far where I collected evidence and suggested problems for each theory: theory A and theory J.)
I will then multiply together the ratios of the probabilities for each piece of evidence to arrive at the relative consequent probabilities.
(For those of you who know Bayes' Theorem, I am starting with equal prior probabilities for the two hypotheses, so I do not have to bother with the usual formula. This reflects what I see as the similarly weak character of the motives proposed for either Adnan or Jay.)
Here we go then, with the pieces of evidence, their probability of being the outcome of theory A and theory J, then the ratio of those probabilities; you are welcome to take issue with my estimates and suggest pieces I missed out:
(i) Asia's evidence. A: 25%, J: 100%, 1:4.
(ii) Lack of corroborating alibis for Adnan at school. A: 100%, J: 40%, 5:2.
(iii) Adnan's stated lack of memory of the material time. A: 80%, J: 50%, 8:5.
(iv) Adnan asking for a ride from Hae, then Hae telling him he could not get a ride, and Adnan saying that was fine. A: 50%, J: 80%, 5:8.
(v) Inez, the concessionaire, seeing Hae get out of her car, and leave it running, but not seeing Adnan around at that point. A: 20%, J: 100%, 1:5.
(vi) Becky reporting hearsay to the effect that Adnan had told Hae his car was in the shop. A: 70%, J: 20%, 7:2.
(vii) Jay stating to police that Adnan planned to tell Hae his car was in the shop, thereby seeming to corroborate Becky's hearsay. A: 100%, J: 30%, 10:3.
(viii) Adnan telling a cop that evening that Hae had left without him after waiting for him. A: 60%, J: 50%, 6:5.
(ix) Adnan much later telling a cop that he would not have asked for a ride from Hae because he had his own car. A: 60%, J: 30%, 2:1.
(x) Many witnesses stating Adnan was not in a murderous mood, but a mystery caller telling police to look into him. A: 20%, J: 80%, 1:4.
(xi) Jen and Jay incriminating Adnan. A: 70%, J: 20%, 7:2.
(xii) The inconsistencies in Jay's statements. A: 80%, J: 90%, 8:9.
(xiii) The phone-call from an as yet unknown number made to Adnan's phone at 2:36. A: 80%, J: 20%, 4:1.
(xiv) Jay's confessed behaviour in assisting Adnan in burying Hae and in destroying the physical evidence implicating himself. A: 40%, J: 100%, 2:5.
To find the relative conditional probabilities, taking all this evidence into consideration, I just multiply the ratios together:
(1x5x8x5x1x7x10x6x2x1x7x8x4x2) / (4x2x5x8x5x2x3x5x1x4x2x9x1x5)
= 75,264,000 / 17,280,000
= 4.36/1 => 81% probability of Adnan being guilty.
In other words, after taking each piece of evidence in turn, and considering its probability of being the outcome of theory A and theory J, I find I have estimated Adnan to be over 4 times more likely to be the murderer than Jay.
I am pretty shocked at this, as I had thought I favoured Adnan's innocence. This perhaps goes to show that, when considering this many pieces of evidence pointing this way and that, one might need to use maths to make sense of it.
However, 4:1 is a ratio with both values of the same order of magnitude, so it could easily be shifted up or down by a moderate reconsideration of the evidence.
Edit: the evidence supporting each theory ranked in terms of strength.
Update for Episode 5: 'Route Talk'
(xv) Prosecution timeline from Woodlawn school to Best Buy telephone only marginally possible at best, and implying very quick murder, and no hesitation in phoning Jay, i.e. a premeditated plan swiftly carried out, not an accident or developing escalation of aggression. Jay is also potentially biased by having to make his story conform to the phone record. If Jay is lying, then no surprise if his story runs into difficulty here. A: 40%, J: 90%, 4:9.
(xvi) Cellphone tower data not matching Jay's story. The only reason this evidence does not write off Jay's story completely, is that Jay might be making mistakes in the details of his story. It is a huge boon for Adnan's defence. A: 5%, J: 95%, 1:19.
(xvii) The impossibility of them going to Patapsco and returning for track-practice. Another massive strike against Jay's reliability. A: 5%, J: 95%, 1:19.
(xviii) Jay recalling Adnan speaking a foreign language, when he speaks none. A huge 'unforced error' by Jay, claiming something happened that is essentially impossible; he appears to be just making it up. A: 2%, J: 96%, 1:48.
(xix) The call to or from Neisha, Adnan's friend but not Jay's, when Jay says Adnan put him on, supposedly at a time when Adnan was at school, but not matching the location where Jay says it took place. Let's see what comes of this in a later episode...
(xx) Call placed to Christa, Adnan's friend but not Jay's, while Jay supposedly had the phone during track-practice. A: 10%, J: 90%, 1:9.
(xxi) Adnan and his phone were probably in Leakin Park after track-practice, according to the cellphone tower data. A: 90%, J: 5%, 19:1.
(xxii) In Jay's story, they tool around for twice as long after track-practice before going to Leakin Park as the tower data would suggest. A: 50%, J: 90%, 5:9.
(xxiii) The 2:36 call to Adnan's phone does not match to Jay's account of when he received the call (3:40-45) or to Jen's account of when Jay left her house (same). Again another gaping hole for the prosecution case. A: 5%, J: 90%, 1:19.
Updated probability calculation:
(4x1x1x2x1x19x5x1) x 4.36 / (9x19x19x48x9x1x9x19) = 828.875 / 2,986,988 = 0.00028/1.
=> 0.00028/1.00028 = 0.00012 = 0.028% probability of Adnan being guilty as per Jay's story!
Episode 5 damaged Jay's story so badly, that it completely reversed my estimate of Adnan's guilt from 81% to 0.0028%, or approximately 0.
However, this is only a measure of the truth of Adnan's guilt as per Jay's story. What was Adnan (probably) doing at Leakin Park that evening? Could he have been there, involved in Hae's murder and/or burial, but in a different manner from how Jay told the story?
Do we need a third theory? Or can we explain Adnan's proximity to the cellphone tower?
