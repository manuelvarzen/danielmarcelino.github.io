 Polls are finding Donald Trump ahead—way ahead—of other candidates running for the Republican nomination for presidency. Based on a recent Pew Research Center poll, CNN practically declared victory for him, noting he got 25 percent of the votes in the survey. The Daily News wrote off Jeb Bush—pointing to his 4 percent support rate. Ben Carson came in at 16 percent; Carly Fiorina and Marco Rubio won 8 percent.
 
 Another poll conducted in October by MSNBC/Wall Street Journal/Marist, found Donald Trump has the support of 21 percent of the participating Republicans in New Hampshire– down from 28 percent of respondents in September. Fiorina comes in second, with 16 percent support, up from 6 percent a month ago. The same organization found 24 percent support for Trump in Iowa in October, down from 29 percent last month. Ben Carson, second in the lead in Iowa in this poll, captures 19 percent of the support, down from 22 percent last month.
 
  Yet both polls had fewer than 500 participants, resulting in high margins of error (about 5 percent points). When taking the margin of error into consideration, the preferences of Republican voters are far from certain.
  
  But first, what is a margin of error (MOE)? It doesn’t measure most kinds of errors that plague many polls and surveys, like biased questions or selecting survey respondents in a way that’s not random. MOE does not measure a mistake, either. When a random sample of all Republicans is taken—a small group of people meant to be chosen randomly from all the possible likely Republican voters—there is always a possibility that the opinions of those in this sample don’t reflect those of the whole population. The MOE is a measurement of how confident we can be that such a survey of the opinions of a small number of people actually reflects the opinions of the whole population.
Polls like these may have other major problems than simply sampling error. Quite possibly they haven’t accounted correctly for the demographics among the respondents to the polls. If those who respond are poorer, more likely to be white, less likely to be educated, or even less likely to vote, than those who actually vote, the survey will be biased. But assuming all of the issues of who participates in the poll have been adjusted, there’s still sampling error. That’s what the MOE addresses.
   The MOE on the Pew and the NBC/WSJ/Marist polls have been largely neglected, leaving doubt about how much confidence we can have in Trump’s lead. The MOE on a poll with many possible responses is a little more complicated to interpret than a margin of error for a poll offering choices only between two candidates—so much so, it seems that media have avoided talking about its meaning entirely. At best, we’re seeing a nod to the margin of error with a statement of its numerical value.
Of the media sources mentioned, only CNN can be lauded for mentioning the size of the Pew survey and the corresponding MOE. But the interpretation? Left to the reader.
A 5 percent MOE in the national Pew poll means we can be 95 percent confident that Trump has somewhere between 20 and 30 percent support among all likely Republican voters (25 plus or minus 5 percent). In other words, if we were to conduct this survey many times with different samples of 497 randomly chosen Republican voters, 95 out of 100 times the proportion of the survey respondents supporting Trump, plus or minus the MOE, would contain the actual percentage of support in the whole American Republican population. We call the range of 20 to 30 percent support the 95 percent confidence interval for this poll.
