A [post](http://www.r-bloggers.com/odds-odds-ratio-language-and-intuition) by Wingfeet the other day provocatively commented on the lack of intuition of odds ratio (OR). I just don't follow. OR is not such an abstract evil thing more than , An _odds_ is simply a measure of association between an exposure and an outcome and is defined as the ratio of the probability of success and the probability of failure, simply as that. If you don't believe things have probabilities of occurring, then you don't believe in OR. . Perhaps the main reason for why people get confused with OR is because they think in terms of relative risk. 
Actually, odds ratio appears to be gaining popularity over the years. 
  
rather the lack of skill of readers that may cause interpretation problems. Considers for instance a real situation 

The OR represents the odds that an outcome will occur given a particular exposure, compared to the odds of the outcome occurring in the absence of that exposure. 
 The p-value is another thing.

runs <- 10000
intercept <- log(9)

beta <- log(odds.ratio)
proportion  <-  replicate(
              n = runs,
              expr = {
                  xtest <- rnorm(nn)
                  linpred <- intercept + (xtest * beta)
                  prob <- exp(linpred)/(1 + exp(linpred))
                  runis <- runif(length(xtest),0,1)
                  ytest <- ifelse(runis < prob,1,0)
                  prop <- length(which(ytest <= 0.5))/length(ytest)
                  }
            )
summary(proportion)

              n = runs,
              expr = {
                  xtest <- rnorm(nn)
                  linpred <- intercept + (xtest * beta)

                  ytest <- ifelse(runis < prob,1,0)
                  summary(model <- glm(ytest ~ xtest,  family = "binomial"))$coefficients[2,4] < .05
                  }
            )
print(sum(result)/runs)
