#Flowers/Fractals 
Last week, I attended the "Flower Fest" where I had the opportunity to admire several of the most beautiful flowers, orchids, and decoration plants. 
Surprisingly, though , I never had thought on flowers the way I did this time. Most of them are like [fractals](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fractal) in their beauty.  
 
Fractals attract lots of interest, specially from mathematicians who actually spend some time trying to learn about their structures. A fractal is defined as an object that displays self-similarity on all scales. But the object doesn't need to have exactly the same structure at all scales only the same sort of structure must be visible or recognizable any how. 

The structure or the equation that rule a fractal is most of the time very simple. 
For instance, the formula for the famous [Mandelbrot](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandelbrot_set) is $$z_{n+1}=z_n^2+c$$. 
We start by plugging in a constant value for $c$ for each test of the above equation. $z$ can starts at zero. Next, the equation gives us a new value for $Z$; then we plug this back into the equation at old $z$ and iterate it again, and so forth.
Simple example:
Let's start this time with c = 1.

$$z_{1} = z_{02} + c= 0 + 1 = 1$$
$$z_{2} = z_{12} + c = 1 + 1 = 2$$
$$z_{3} = z_{22} + c = 4 + 1 = 5$$

Graphing these results against n would create an upward parabolic curve because the numbers increase exponentially (to infinity). But if we start with c = -1 for instance, $z$ will behave completely different. That is, it will oscillate between two fixed points as: 

$$z_{1} = z_{02} + c= 0 + -1 = -1$$
$$z_{2} = z_{12} + c = 1 + (-1) = 0$$
$$z_{3} = z_{22} + c = 0 + (- 1) = -1$$
$$z_{4} = z_{32} + c = 1 + (- 1) = 0$$

And this oscillation will continue forever as we can imagine. The Mandelbrot set is made up of all the values for $z$ that stay finite, so most solutions such as those for when $c = 1$ are thrown out because $z$ in those cases goes to infinity.

To do this yourself you may need to install the package caTools.
