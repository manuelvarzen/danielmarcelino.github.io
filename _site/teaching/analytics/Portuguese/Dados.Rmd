## Public Utilities
Characteristics of 22 public utilities (Table 12.4)

## Bankruptcy Data
  
Annual financial data of financially sound firms (last column, indicator 1) and for the last two years before firms went bankrupt (last column, indicator 0). Data are in the form of ratios of cash flow to total debt (column 1), net income to total assets (column 2), current assets to total liabilities (column 3) and current assets to net sales (column 4).

## Senators voting data 
Voting records of Senators of the 109th US Congress (2005-07) as culled from the Congressional Database by Banerjee et al. (2008). Here, "1" denotes voting in favor, "-1" denotes voting against while "0" means a vote not recorded. The voting resolutions are in the rows while the votes are the columns.Also,the first row of the file contains their names, states and affiliations.

## Anaconda data
Data on snout vent length, weight and gender of anaconda snakes (Table 6.19).

## Egyptian Skulls Data
Measurements in mm on maximum breadth (column 1), basibregmatic height (column 2), basialveolar length (column 3) and nasal height (column 4) of male Egyptian skulls from (column 5) period 1 (4000 BC), period 2 (3300 BC) and period 3 (1850 BC).


## Painted Turtles Data
Data from 24 female and 24 male (column 1 -- male = 2, female = 1) on logarithms of carapace length, breadth and height.

## Vowels Training Data
              
Speaker independent recognition of the eleven steady state vowels (column 2) of British English using a specified training set of lpc (linear predictive analysis) derived log area ratios.The objective is the recognition of vowel sounds from multiple speakers. Deterding (1998) recorded examples of the eleven steady state vowels of English spoken by fifteen speakers (eight training and seven test) for a speaker normalisation study. Each speaker yielded six frames of speech from eleven vowels. This gave 528 frames from the eight speakers used to train the classifier.

## Vowels Test Data
Vowels test data from the seven test speakers, resulting in 462 frames for the test dataset.

## Mali Family Farm Data

## Image test data
