      <div class="entry">
        <p>There is not a huge population of opinion polls covering this parliamentary election in Venezuela, but all I&#39;ve can be used to gauge the public opinion by the local polling houses. This posting begs an obvious question: how has the mood in Venezuela varied over time with respect to voting intentions for the two political blocs? Next, can we detect any biases among those publishing polls?</p>

      <div class="entry">
        <p>Next Sunday Venezuelans are heading to the polls once again with  international concerns about the clearness of the balloting. To get an idea about the political climate over there, I&#39;ve collected some polls available on the internet. The surprising thing from those surveys is a tremendous variability from pollster to pollster about the single topic of voting intention. You may find national polls fielded in the same period with estimates varying as much as 20%, isn&#39;t it dramatic? If you always wanted to see house bias operating in practice, the Venezuelan elections may provide you a good case then.   </p>

      <div class="entry">
        <p>Just few hours before Greeks head to the polls to decide on the bailout agreement, and ultimately, whether the country will stay in the euro, there is no overwhelming advantage of either side. Actually, the margin became blurred over the last three days, with the &quot;Yes&quot; position rehearsing a last-minute recovery. Despite this last-minute trend, the aggregate preference for the “NO” is not too far behind. To frame this in terms of probabilities, when the \( \theta_{YES} \) exceeds \( \theta_{NO} \), I adapted a short <a href="https://gist.github.com/danielmarcelino/9522c58c1dbbd3acc805#file-greek-thing-r">function</a> written a while <a href="http://danielmarcelino.com/bayes-says-dont-worry-about-scotlands-referendum/">ago</a> to simulate from a Dirichlet distribution and to compute posterior probabilities shown in the chart below. It’s really nothing, but the <em>YES</em> outperformed the <em>NO</em> in <em>57%</em> of the times.</p>
