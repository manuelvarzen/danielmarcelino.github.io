On Stack Exchange, we believe the core moderators should come from the community, and be elected by the community itself through popular vote. We hold regular elections to determine who these community moderators will be.

Community moderators are accorded the highest level of privilege on our community, and should themselves be exemplars of positive behavior and leaders within the community.

Our general criteria for moderators are as follows:

patient and fair
leads by example
shows respect for their fellow community members in their actions and words
open to some light but firm moderation to keep the community on track and resolve (hopefully) uncommon disputes and exceptions
For the Stack Overflow election, an eligible candidate for the election must have all of the following badges:

Civic Duty
Strunk & White
Deputy
Convention
Due to the size of Stack Overflow (averaging nearly 2,000 flags per day!), moderation can be a significant responsibility - if you can't dedicate at least 30 minutes each day to help shoulder the load, please defer to those who can.

Every election has three phases:

Nomination
Primary
Election
Please participate in the moderator elections by voting, and perhaps even by nominating yourself to be a community moderator!

Election chat room - discuss the election, candidates, etc.

### Introduction 
Google has a tool for tracking the frequency of words or phrases across its vast collection of scanned texts, the Google Books. The [Google Ngram Viewer](https://books.google.com/ngrams) reports data and graphs the frequency of words, encoutered in several language corpus over time. For instance, the chart above campares the appearance in the English corpus of the following names: "Karl Marx", "Max Weber", "Emile Durkheim". These thinkers are considered the founding fathers of sociology because they set out to develop pratical and scientifically sound methods of research to examine theories of the social world rooted in a specific historical and cultural context. From the chart above, we can conclude that Marx is the most famous sociologist among the others founding fathers, with a peak in popularity about 1975-6, but his influence has been declining ever since. 

### Using R with Google Ngram Viewer
There is a package to query the Google Ngram called [ngramr](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ngramr/index.html) written by Sean Carmody. With this pacakge, one can retrieve data from Ngram pages in the form of data frame.  

### Getting Started
The first thing to do is to load the `ggplot2` and `ngramr` packages. In case you don't have them installled, an intallation is required.

```{r 'load/install'}
pks <- c("ggplot2", "ngramr", "SciencesPo")
lapply(pks, library, character.only = TRUE)
```



### Write a Query and Do the Plots
In the following, we retrieve the frequency for the term "Capitalism".

```{r 'Capitalism', fig.width=9, fig.height=6}
ng <- c("(Capitalism)")
ggram(ng, year_start = 1800, google_theme = TRUE) +
     theme_538()
```   
    
In the following, we retrieve the frequency for the term "Capitalism".


### Write a Query and Do the Plots
In the following, I test the popularity of XX in the frequency of words.

```{r 'Jesus Popularity', fig.width=9, fig.height=6}
ng <- c("((Jesus + Christ) / God)")
ggram(ng, year_start = 1500, 
      year_end = 2012,  
      smoothing = 3,
      google_theme = FALSE) +
    theme_538()
```   
    

```{r 'democracy', fig.width=9, fig.height=6}
ng <- c("((The Data is + The Data has) / The Data)",
      "((The Data are + The Data have) / The Data)")
ggram(ng, year_start = 1800, google_theme = TRUE) +
  theme(legend.direction = "vertical")
```
