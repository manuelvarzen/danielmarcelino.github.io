# The famous Swiss case 
For many years an official Swiss publication explained the working of the D'Hondt system by means of an illustration which sought to show that if in an election with a total of 60,000 votes and ten members to be elected electors had voted for five parties on the pattern:

```{r 'Swiss'}
Party A 36,000
Party B 12,000
Party C 6,000
Party D 5,000
Party E 1,000

results <- c(A=36000, B=12000, C=6000,
D=5000, E=1000)
```
The, the seat allocation would be:

```{r 'Swiss2'}
Party A 6
Party B 2
Party C 1
Party D 1
Party E 0
```

The illustration was wrong in fact. The application of the D'Hondt system would result in an allocation of seats as indicated:


```{r 'Swiss2'}
results <- c(A=36000, B=12000, C=6000, D=5000, E=1000)

dHondt(parties=names(results), votes=results, seats=10)
```
