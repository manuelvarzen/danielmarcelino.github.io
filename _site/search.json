I was invited to present the R package SciencesPo for an eclectic crowd.

The title and figures caught my attention more than the subject of the conference, I’ve to confess.</p>

<p>The plot below, taken from the paper, displays the most significant finding from the analysis: <em>a strong dependence on session chair gender</em>. Overall, males ask more question than females, but there is a large difference in number of questions asked by males vis-à-vis number asked by females, given a male or female chair. I’m wondering if this also holds for other science fields where the gap between male and female researchers is that not abnormal.</p>

It might be too early to state anything solid, but the few polls prospecting the runoff election in Argentina seem to be telling two distinct histories. Polling houses <em>Hugo Haime</em> and <em>IPSOS</em> suggest that Daniel Scioli is going up while <em>Elypsis</em>  and <em>Polldata</em> say he’s actually sinking as the weeks go by. The last poll published today by <em>Polldata</em> puts Scioli below 40%, with about 5% reporting being undecided. My experience following  multiparty elections suggests that polls perform much better in the runoff than in primaries, meaning that the average of the polls now is much more close to the real vote preference than reported before.</p>

The showcases in the book draw upon libraries like the <strong>boot</strong> by Angelo Canty and Brian Ripley, which is a great package. However, I’d love to find in the book more examples on “how to do my own bootstrap program” instead, so I decided to write down these lines.
